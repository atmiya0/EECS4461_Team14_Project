# Ground Rules

These define what group members expect from one another and what norms they agree on relating to behaviours and actions. Below are examples of the types of areas it is important to address and examples of what form they might take. 

| Area | Principles & Norms *All members of the group agree to:*  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Communication** | Use discord as the primary means of communicating. Respond to messages within a day. Respect other people ideas Use discord voice channel and video collaboration tools to work as a team. Listen to other members and we will let everyone to speak. |
| **Meetings** | Meet up and update each other on work being done before class as well as throughout the weeks through discord.  Sharing documents will be on Google Docs. Participate in every meeting. Any other meetings will be decided on discord on a case by case basis   |
| **Deadlines** | No deterministic deadlines set at the moment, try to finish everything a couple days to a week before a deadline to ensure that we have time to pivot and recourse if needed. |

| Care Statement Outline here how the team will strive to care for the health of each other and the team as a whole during the project duration: |
| :---- |
| Make sure to check in with each other as much as possible to ensure that no one is over working and that no one is being overworked. Everyone will keep an open mind and be inclusive.  |
