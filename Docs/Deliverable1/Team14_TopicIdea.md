# **Section 1: Phenomena of Interest**

Social media platforms use algorithms to highlight and amplify the outreach of trending topics. AI-driven bots can manipulate these trends by artificially increasing engagement on posts to have higher chances of being picked up by the algorithm, this phenomenon is called metric manipulation. This phenomenon is found in most social media but we will focus on a decentralized social networking app like **BlueSky**.

The key dynamic of the social bots can include mass-like posts, repost content, and interact with hashtags to boost or suppress specific narratives of one’s choosing. This could spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, and can artificially inflate an individual's platform. Additionally, bots can also mass-report posts and accounts to push them out of the algorithm. Moreover, it is important to note that both AI-Human and AI-AI interactions will occur. Examples of this could be as the following: 

* **AI-Human Interaction:**   
  * AI bots boosting human posts for setting trends, manipulating public opinion, and increasing a brand/user account.  
* **AI-AI Interaction:**   
  * Bot creates a post on a topic, and a cluster of bots creates artificial engagement with the post.
